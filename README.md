# Splice

A modern, modal text editor, written from the ground up in Rust.
Plans have been made to include the following:

- A client/server model for editing text from multiple clients
- A plugin model for the server, to make extensions simple and easy to use
- Asynchronous I/O with libuv for responsive editing
- A lightweight, simple client as a proof of concept
- And much more!

This is just a personal project I'll be working on over my break, and may or
may not ever be finished. If you'd like to contribute, please report any issues
you find or send in a pull request.
